# DifferentialEquations
Inspired by the WaveEquation, I implemented all kinds of equations to this one. 2d versions coming soon.

This program models a few partial differential equations. Currently implemented:

1-dimensional:
- wave equation
- heat equation
- transport equation
- transport equation with decay

2-dimensional:
at least heat and wave coming soon


This could be used to get a more intuitive understanding of ODE:s. Maybe a scripting language could be implemented
so all kinds of equations could be tried? I'm planning on adding sliders for the coefficients and more info about
the equations.
