# DifferentialEquations
Inspired by the WaveEquation, I implemented all kinds of equations to this one.

This program models currently the wave equation and the heat equation in both the 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional cases. 

Also a bugged version of the wave equation was left into the program, since it was fun to play with (reduce the tension parameter to increase fun!)

This could be used to get a more intuitive understanding of PDE:s. Maybe a scripting language could be implemented
so all kinds of equations could be tried?
